Other functions from the initial newfeature branch version are included here was well


 * Added "solid_pixel" tag to shot data definitions (gtbot)
	- In a shot data definition, if you add solid_pixel = true, the bullet will be rendered on solid pixels, preserving image quality.
 * Added SetTextureRenderMethod (gtbot)
	- Argument 1: Texture Width/Height determination
	- Determines how future loaded textures' internal widths and heights are determined
		* D3DX_DEFAULT: Textures will be rounded up to a power of 2 (blurry if not in a power of 2, but faster)
		* D3DX_DEFAULT_NONPOW2: Textures will not be rounded up to a power of 2 (crisper image if not in a power of 2, but slower)
	- Keep in mind that changes to this will only affect textures loaded after this function was called.
	- D3DX_DEFAULT is the default value.
 * Added SetShotDelayRenderBlendType (gtbot)
    - Argument 1: Blend Type
    - Globally forces all delay clouds to use the specified blend type
    - Use BLEND_NONE to disable this. BLEND_NONE is the default value.
 * Added GetShotDelayRenderBlendType (gtbot)
    - returns the value that's specified in SetShotDelayRenderBlendType
 * Added ObjMove_SetProcessMovement (gtbot)
	- Argument 1: object ID
	- Argument 2: set movement processing on/off (boolean)
	- Determines whether the specified object will run their movement process or not.
	- Exercise caution when using ObjMove_SetProcessMovement, as objects will never move again until you restore their movement.
	- true is the default value.
 * Added ObjMove_GetProcessMovement (gtbot)
	- Argument 1: object ID
	- returns the value that's specified in ObjMove_SetProcessMovement
 * Added ObjSpell_SetEraseShotType (gtbot)
    - Argument 1: ObjSpell ID
    - argument 2: bullet collision behaviour 
    - Sets the behaviour of ObjSpells when colliding with an enemy bullet
    - TO_TYPE_ITEM is the default value
      * TO_TYPE_ITEM: Deletes bullets and spawns an item 
      * TO_TYPE_IMMEDIATE: Immediately deletes bullets
      * TO_TYPE_FADE: Sets bullets to fade out and delete
	  * TO_TYPE_MOVEMENT_FREEZE: Stops the movement processing of bullets
	  * TO_TYPE_MOVEMENT_RESTORE: Restores the movement processing of bullets
	- Exercise caution when using TO_TYPE_MOVEMENT_FREEZE, as the bullets will never move again until you restore their movement.
	- ObjMove_SetProcessMovement can also restore these frozen bullets, and vice versa
 * Added ObjShot_SetEraseShotType (gtbot)
    - Argument 1: ObjShot ID
    - argument 2: bullet collision behaviour 
	- When bullets are set to erase shots, their behaviour can be changed with this function.
	- Argument 2 accepts the same constants found in ObjSpell_SetEraseShotType.
    - TO_TYPE_ITEM is the default value
