Added GRAZE_INVALID_NONE



 * Added SetShotGrazeInvalidFrame
	- Argument 1: Defaulted graze invalid frame
	- Sets the default amount of frames that must pass before a bullet can be grazed again
	- Applies to all bullets fired after this was set
	- Use GRAZE_INVALID_NONE to reset this value to normal (meaning it can only be grazed once).
	- Default value is GRAZE_INVALID_NONE 
 * Added SetShotInvalidIntersectionDistance
	- Argument 1: Distance in pixels
	- Sets the distance in pixels to automatically disable and enable regular bullet hitboxes
	- When outside the distance, hitboxes are entirely disabled for the bullet. When inside the distance, they behave as usual. 
	- This does not apply to laser type bullets
	- This is calculated by using GetPlayerX/Y and ObjMove_GetX/Y only! This means that radii are NOT accounted for.
	- Also note that this will also disable collisions with spell objects that are out of range as well.
	- It's best to use this only in your own distributed packaged scripts/players, as this function may easily cause problems.
	- Set this value to 0 to disable this function.
	- Default value is 0
 * Added ObjShot_SetGrazeInvalidFrame
	- Argument 1: ObjShot ID
	- Argument 2: Graze invalid frame
	- Sets the amount of frames that must pass before the specified bullet can be grazed again
	- Use GRAZE_INVALID_NONE to reset this value to normal.
	- Default value is GRAZE_INVALID_NONE
 * Added ObjShot_GetGrazeStatus
	- Argument 1: ObjShot ID
	- Returns true if the player is colliding with the specified bullet's graze hitbox
 * ObjShot_SetDamageReductionRate
	- Argument 1: ObjShot ID
	- Argument 2: Damage reduction rate
	- Sets the rate at which the specified bullet's damage will be reduced by based on the total number of bullets colliding with a single enemy on a single frame.
		- Example: 3 bullets hit the same enemy in the same frame, with 10 damage each and 1 damage reduction rate:
		- Bullet 1 will deal 10 damage, bullet 2 will deal 5 damage, and bullet 3 will deal 3.33 damage
	- Default value is 0
 * ObjShot_GetDamageReductionRate
	- Argument 1: ObjShot ID
	- Returns the damage reduction rate specified in ObjShot_SetDamageReductionRate
