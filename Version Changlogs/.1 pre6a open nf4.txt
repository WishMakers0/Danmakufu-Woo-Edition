Version name of [.1 pre6a open nf4] 

(WishMakers)
-All archive files tested confirmed to work - this includes plain text files within archives like shaders, mqo, and dds that didn't work previously.

-Config was changed to match the standard set by Ephemeral Unnatural Balance's config menu:
  * Chinese is now supported in the config.
  * Menus were made bigger so it is now easier to see options in the key and options menu.
  * Window title was finally changed.
  * Font was adjusted to look natural with all three languages displayed (this is easily changeable if you compile yourself, just ask me in FnC/Bullet Hell Engines on Discord.
  * Confirmed controller support with the config menu and adjustable controls - tested with XInput controllers, the Wired Faceoff Nintendo Switch controller, and DualShock 4.

-Fixed the zlib build path for the source.  Should compile regardless of vcpkg now.

 * Added SetPlayerItemScope
	- Argument 1: Item intersection radius
	- Sets the radius (in pixels) of the circle in which you collect items.
	- Use GetPlayerItemScope to obtain the current value.
	- Default value is 24.

 * Added SetPlayerStateEndEnable
	- Argument 1: Boolean for enabling the end state.
	- Sets the state that determines whether the "end script" state is set after a game over.
	- Default value is true.

 * Added SetPlayerShootdownEventEnable
	- Argument 1: Boolean for enabling the EV_PLAYER_SHOOTDOWN event.
	- Default value is true.

 * Added SetPlayerRebirthPosition
	- Argument 1: X coordinate of respawn.
	- Argument 2: Y coordinate of respawn.
	- Sets the position that the player respawns after losing a life.
	- Default x value: StgFrame's width / 2
	- Default y value: StgFrame's bottom coordinate - 48

 * Added wait
	- Argument 1: Frames to yield
	- I mean, who here *hasn't* used this function before when making scripts?  Should be self explanatory.

 * Added continue
	- Used as if you were using a break statement within a loop:
	
	while(condition) {
		if(whatever) {
			break; //use continue here
		}
	}
	
	- Instead of breaking out of the loop entirely, skips the rest of that iteration and jumps back to the start of the loop.

 * Added GetPlayerAutoCollectLine
	- Returns the height in pixels at which the Point of Collection resides.
	- Can be changed with SetPlayerAutoCollectLine
